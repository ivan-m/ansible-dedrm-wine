# You may have troubles with Kindle accessing the internet due to a

# being removed.
#
# This will install a local copy of the certificate in the wine
# prefix.
#
# Note however that toggling this will _not_ uninstall the prefix: you
# will need to either:
#
# 1) Use the uninstaller and start afresh
#
# 2) Run `WINEPREFIX={{ wine_prefix }} wine control`, go to Internet
#    Settings, Content, Certificates, Trusted Root Certification
#    Authorities, choose "VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary
#    Certification Authority - G5" then Remove.
